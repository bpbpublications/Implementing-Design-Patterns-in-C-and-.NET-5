# Implementing Design Patterns in C# and .NET 5

Build Scalable, Fast, and Reliable .NET Applications Using the Most Common Design Patterns

This is the repository for [Implementing Design Patterns in C# and .NET 5](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/implementing-design-patterns-in-c-and-net-5?_pos=1&_sid=942f2a738&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
This book covers detailed aspects of Design Patterns and Object-Oriented Programming concepts using the most modern version of the C# language and .NET platform, including many real-world examples and good practice guidelines that help developers in building robust and extensible applications.

The book begins with the essential concepts of C# programming and the .NET platform. You get your foundation strong by understanding SOLID Principles and the actual implementation of reliable applications. You will be working on most common Design Patterns such as Abstract Factory, Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Command, Strategy, Observer, Factory Method, Singleton, Builder, Interpreter, Mediator, and many other patterns that will help you to create solid enterprise applications. You will also witness the performance of these design patterns in a real software development environment with the help of practical examples.

After learning the most common Design Patterns practiced in .NET enterprise applications, the reader will be able to understand and apply good practices of software development based on the object-oriented paradigm to develop complex enterprise applications efficiently and simply. 

## What you will learn
* Fine-tune your knowledge about interfaces, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
* Learn to practice implementing design patterns in enterprise applications.
* Implement rich design patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command, Proxy, and more.
